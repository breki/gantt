# gantt

An experiment in implementing task scheduling and Gantt diagram in F#.


## What is the plan?

1. Implement a task scheduling engine.
2. Implement visualization of a Gantt diagram (probably in HTML or SVG, 
   perhaps as an embedded web server).
3. Implement a text-based DSL for defining tasks and dependencies and a parser 
   for it.
